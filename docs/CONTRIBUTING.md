### Pull Requests

#### Before You Start
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** - `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Discuss major changes** - Open an issue first for big changes

#### Development Guidelines

**Code Style**
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Keep lines under 100 characters when reasonable
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings for all functions and classes

**Example:**

def discover_services(target_ip: str, timeout: int = 5) -> dict:
    """
    Discover services running on target IP.
    
    Args:
        target_ip: IP address to scan
        timeout: Connection timeout in seconds
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary of discovered services
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

**Testing**
- Test on **both Windows and Linux** if modifying core functionality
- Verify all tools still work independently
- Test SeekSweet orchestrator with your changes
- Ensure CIDR expansion works correctly
- Check persistent tracking isn't broken

**Documentation**
- Update README.md if adding features
- Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
- Update tool-specific documentation if applicable
- Include code comments for complex logic

**Commit Messages**
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
