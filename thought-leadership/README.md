## Tips for Effective Analysis

1. **Start with Known Domains** - Use corporate domains, not IP addresses
2. **Review JSON Output** - Parse JSON for automated processing
3. **Check Redirects** - Note final URLs for additional discovery
4. **Cross-Reference** - Combine with DNS enumeration for subdomains
5. **Read the Guide** - Review THOUGHT_LEADERSHIP_GUIDE.txt for methodology
6. **Monitor Over Time** - Track changes to identify new content
7. **Extract Metadata** - Download PDFs/documents for metadata analysis

## Limitations

- Requires domain names (not just IP addresses)
- May miss content behind authentication
- Subject to rate limiting on public sites
- Some social media platforms may block automated access
- Content discovery depends on common path patterns

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This tool is designed for authorized security assessments and OSINT research only.

- Always obtain proper authorization before reconnaissance
- Follow applicable laws and regulations (CFAA, GDPR, etc.)
- Respect website terms of service
- Use gathered intelligence ethically and responsibly
- Report any discovered vulnerabilities through proper channels
