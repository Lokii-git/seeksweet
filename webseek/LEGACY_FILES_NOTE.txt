# Legacy Files Location

The legacy WebSeek v1 files have been removed from the GitHub repository but are preserved locally.

## Local Files (Not in GitHub)

Located in: `webseek/`

- **webseek-v1-legacy.py** - Original custom scanner (~750 lines)
- **README-v1-legacy.md** - Original documentation

These files are excluded via `.gitignore` patterns:
- `*-v1-legacy.py`
- `*-legacy.md`

## Why Removed from GitHub?

- Reduces repository clutter
- Main version is now Nuclei-powered (webseek.py)
- Legacy version preserved locally for reference only
- Most users should use the new v2.0

## If You Need the Legacy Version

The legacy files are:
1. **Available locally** in the webseek directory
2. **In git history** before commit ab9ac90 (if you need to recover them)
3. **Documented** in README-v1-legacy.md (local only)

## To Use Legacy Version

```bash
cd webseek
python webseek-v1-legacy.py iplist.txt -v
```

## Recommended: Use Current Version

```bash
cd webseek
python webseek.py  # New Nuclei-powered version
```

The current version (v2.0) is superior in every way except it requires Nuclei to be installed.
